# Smart Phone usage Productivity Dashboard Using Excel
## Project Objective
These dashboard provide a quick snapshot of smartphone usage patterns and their relationship with productivity, sleep, and stress across different user groups.						

# Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/Keerthisriram/Data-Analyst-Excel-Dashboard/blob/main/Smartphone_Usage_Productivity_Dataset_50000.csv.xlsx">Data Set</a>

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)						
						
- Average Daily Phone Usage – Measures overall screen time per day.						
- Average Social Media Usage – Shows time spent on social platforms daily.						
- Work Productivity Score – Indicates users’ productivity levels.						
- Average Sleep Hours – Tracks sleep duration and digital lifestyle impact.						
- Average Stress Level – Reflects mental stress associated with phone usage.						
- App Usage Count – Represents frequency of app usage and multitasking.						
- Weekend Screen Time – Compares leisure usage vs weekdays.						
- Caffeine Intake (Cups/Day) – Links lifestyle habits with sleep and stress.						
- User Segmentation – Breakdown by age, gender, occupation, and device type (Android/iOS).

## Process:

- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies and sort out the same.
- Make sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type.
- Created Pivot table according to the KPI'S.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

## Project Insight

- Productivity Index: Higher productivity scores observed among users with moderate daily smartphone usage and limited social media time.
- Stress Impact KPI: Increased daily and weekend screen time correlates with higher stress levels and reduced productivity.

## Conclusion
The analysis indicates a significant relationship between smartphone usage patterns and individual productivity outcomes. Moderate daily smartphone use, particularly with controlled social media engagement, is associated with higher work productivity scores and better sleep duration. In contrast, excessive daily and weekend screen time correlates with increased stress levels and reduced productivity.
